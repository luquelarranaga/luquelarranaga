## Heyyy I'm Maria:)

On my little journey into tech right now! I've always loved logical puzzles, from non-verbal reasoning exercises in school, to Excel formulas and macros in my marketing job, and now finally coding. Some would say it was meant to be ✨ 

Currently studying programming with Northcoders, where we're covering the fundamentals of JS, front-end/back-end sheets and programming concepts. I'll be open to work as a Junior Software Engineer after graduating in March wooo woooo! 

In the meantime, I'm excited become a part of the coding community, make new friends and continue growing. Don't be shy and say hi <3
